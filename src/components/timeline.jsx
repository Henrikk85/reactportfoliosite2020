                        <p>Vali-IT is an adult retraining program that prepares junior software developers to enter the IT industry. I was selected to be in the program by various tests and an interview and the main focus during the courses was learning the basics of C# and utilizing it on the .Net platform.</p>

                        <p>The initial reason for founding Funktech was to enhance and support my career as a freelance developer. As I also studied economics it was also a logical step for me to become an entrepreneur. At first we were mostly focused on WordPress as a platform but as we got to know the local market we soon realized it has it's certain aspects and limits, so at the moment we are mostly working on how to establish ourselves on the global market of web development, digital marketing and also maybe even IoT if we need to adjust according to the market.</p>

                        <p>I started pursuing my studies regarding web design & digital graphics (specializing in web technologies) as I knew that these skills were quite expensive to hire and well sought after regarding digital marketing. My initial goal was also to find and create new contacts with people who were more tech-savvy than myself and maybe form a team. Little did I know that the courses regarding web-development sparkled an interest in me and that I found myself also a new hobby that I could pursue also professionally.</p>
